\section{Introduction}

This particle is a \PBpm particle.
This is the symbol for a positron: $\APelectron$.
This is also a positron: $\APpositron$
If you want a muon, type $\Pmu$.

Authors must observe the following instructions to ensure consistency
and uniformity in the style and layout of CERN Reports.  Wherever
possible, each contribution will go directly to be printed, without
any editing, and should therefore be in its final form.

Although the typesetting rules that are described are of a general
nature, the present document emphasizes their use with
\LaTeX. Templates and more detailed information for \emph{Word} users
are available on the DTP Web site (\emph{Word} Section at the page
\url{http://cern.ch/DTP/dtpcernreport.htm}).
 
Note that it is the author's responsibility to obtain permission from
the copyright holder if material taken from other sources is included
in the source submitted as a CERN Report.

\section{Generalities on typing}

When submitting your electronic source in \LaTeX{}, you must use the
\texttt{cernrep} class file, which is available from the DTP Web site
(\url{http://cern.ch/DTP}). Moreover, specific instructions for preparing
your \LaTeX{} contribution are given in the appendices.

\subsection{Format for the text}
 
Take care that your material stays inside the text frame which is
16~cm $\times$ 24~cm (\ie a A4 sized paper has 3.0~cm margins at the
top and at the bottom, and 2.5~cm left and right). This is expecially
true for figures and tabular content.

\section{Parts of the text}

\subsection{Abstract}

Your contribution should be preceded by an abstract of not more than
150 words, written as a single paragraph.


\subsection{Sectioning commands and paragraphs}
\label{sec:sections}

The standard \LaTeX{} commands \Lcs{section} (level 1),
\Lcs{subsection} (level 2), \Lcs{subsubsection} (level 3),
\Lcs{subsubsubsection} (level 4), should be used for headings.  Do not
start a new section on a new page, but continue on the same page.

In the text, leave a blank line after each paragraph.

\subsection{Equations}
\label{sec:equations}

Equations should be treated as part of the text, and therefore
punctuated (with a space between the end of the equation and the
punctuation mark).  Equations are numbered consecutively throughout
the report. 

An unnumbered single formula is delimited by \Lcs{[} and \Lcs{]}
(alternatively a \Lenv{displaymath} environment can be used), while a
numbered equation is generated with the \Lenv{equation} environment.
You should \textbf{never} use the \texttt{\$\$} construct.  The CERN
\LaTeX{} classes automatically load the \texttt{amsmath} class, which
offers a large choice of constructs for typesetting
mathematics~\cite{bib:voss2005}. See also Appendix~\ref{app:amsmath}
for some hints about using the \texttt{amsmath} extensions in an
optimal way.

For cross-referencing equations use the \LaTeX{} commands \Lcs{label}
and \Lcs{ref}, as explained in \Sref{sec:crossref}.
A simple example, with a cross-reference to a formula, follows.

\begin{verbatim}
\section{Section title}
\label{sec:mysection}
Einstein has expressed the relation between energy $E$ 
and mass $m$ in his famous equation~(\ref{eq:einstein}):
\begin{equation}
E=mc^2 \label{eq:einstein}
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Figures}
\label{sec:figures}

\subsubsection{How to supply figures}

Where possible, figures should be prepared electronically.  Make sure
that the image is of high quality when printed (in black and white)
and is of high enough resolution (min. 300 dots per inch). We accept
PICT, TIFF, PNG,and JPEG files.  Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) files
are preferred, but in any case, send us your illustrations in their
\emph{original} format (PNG, JPEG, \etc), there is no need for you to
reprocess them yourself.

If you cannot provide electronic copies, or if we consider that your
files do not print out well, you should provide a good-quality paper
original. In this case we will arrange for it to be scanned at CERN
and included in the report.

Do not use free-hand lettering for the labelling of figures. All lines
should be drawn in red or black ink and be heavy enough (min. 0.75
point) and all figures, decimal points, symbols, \etc, large enough
and sufficiently spaced to ensure clarity when printed \emph{at the
final size}. If using colour, please ensure that the figure prints
clearly in greyscale and adapt your text knowing that the difference
between coloured items when reproduced in grey is not obvious.

As already mentioned, before using material such as illustrations
taken from other sources, do not forget to obtain permission from the
copyright holder.

\subsubsection{Positioning and layout}

All figures must remain within the page area (\Unit{16}{cm} $\times$
\Unit{24}{cm}), where, if necessary, the page may be turned 90$^\circ$
to accommodate the figure. When this is done, the caption must be
oriented in the same way as the figure, and no other text may appear
on that page.  The bottom of the turned illustrations should be at the
right-hand side of the page.

\subsubsection{Including your figure}

Figures are included with the \Lenv{figure} environment. In the
example that follows we include an EPS graphics file
(\texttt{myfig.eps}, where the extension \texttt{.eps} does not need
to be specified since it is the default) with the
\Lcs{includegraphics} command, which is defined in the
\texttt{graphicx} package that is loaded by default by the CERN
\LaTeX{} classes.

The figure caption (specified as argument of the \Lcs{caption}
command), must \emph{follow} the figure body, and should be brief. No
full stop is necessary unless the caption is more that one sentence
long, in which case full punctuation should be used.

\subsubsubsection{Example}

An example with a cross-reference to a figure follows. The reference
is defined by the \Lcs{label} command \emph{following} the
\Lcs{caption} command. A cross-reference is generated with the
\Lcs{ref} command on the second line. Note the cross-reference key
(\texttt{fig:myfig}) which clearly indicates that it refers to a
figure (see \Sref{sec:crossref} for a discussion of the importance of
using good keys).
\begin{verbatim}
\section{Section title}
In Fig.~\ref{fig:myfig} we see that ...
\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{myfig}
\caption{Description of my figure}
\label{fig:myfig}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{References to figures}

\LaTeX's cross-reference mechanism can be used to refer to figures.  A
figure is defined with the \Lcs{label} command, which must
\emph{follow} the \Lcs{caption} command.

Figures must be referenced in the text in consecutive numerical order
with the help of the \Lcs{ref} command. Examples of references to
figures and how to produce them follow (see also \Tref{tab:predef}).
\begin{itemize}
\item `Fig. 3' produced by, \eg \verb!\Fref{fig:myfig}!,
\item `Figs. 3--5' produced by, \eg
       \verb!\Figures~\ref{fig:myfiga}--\ref{fig:myfigb}!,
\item `Figure 3', produced by, \eg \verb!\Figure[b]~\ref{fig:myfig}!. 
       Note the use of the optional argument \texttt{[b]}, which
       indicates that the word `Figure' should be typeset in full,
       in particular at the beginning of a sentence.
\end{itemize}
Figures with several parts are cited as follows: `Fig. 2(a) and (b),
Figs. 3(a)--(c)'.

Figures and illustrations \emph{should follow} the paragraph in which
they are first discussed.  If this is not feasible, they may be placed
on the following page (\LaTeX{}'s float mechanism takes care of this
automatically, in principle). If it is not possible to place
\emph{all} numbered figures in the text, then they should \emph{all}
be placed at the end of the paper.

\subsection{Tables}

Tables are defined the the \texttt{table} environment.  Each table
should be centred on the page width, with a brief caption (specified
as argument of the \Lcs{caption} command) \emph{preceding} the table
body.

In general, tables should be open, drawn with a double thin horizontal
line (0.4~pt) at the top and bottom, and single horizontal line
(0.4~pt) separating column headings from data.

Like figures, tables must be referenced in the text in consecutive
numerical order with \LaTeX's \Lcs{ref} command. Examples of
cross-references to tables follow (commands that can be used to
generate the given text strings are shown between parentheses): `Table
5' (\eg \verb!\Tref{tab:mytab}! or \verb!\Table~\ref{tab:mytab}!),
`Tables 2--3' (\eg
\verb!\Tables~\ref{tab:mytaba}--\ref{tab:mytabb}!). The word `Table'
should never be abbreviated.

\subsubsection{Formatting and layout within the table}

Write the headings in sentence case but do not use full stops. Units
should be entered in parentheses on a separate line below the column
heading. (If the same unit is used throughout the table, it should be
written in parentheses on a separate line below the caption.)

Unsimilar items should be aligned on the left, whereas similar items
should be aligned on the operator or decimal point. All decimal points
must be preceded by a digit.

\subsubsubsection{Table captions}

Table captions should be brief and placed centrally \emph{above} the
table. No full stop is necessary unless the caption is more that one
sentence long, in which case full punctuation should be used. 

\subsubsubsection{Notes in the table}

Notes in tables should be designated by superscript lower-case
letters, and begun anew for each table. The superscript letter should
be placed in alphabetical order moving from left to right across the
first row and down to the last. The notes should then be listed
directly under the table.

References cited in tables should appear in consecutive numerical
order, following the order explained above for notes (left to right,
top to bottom).  They should appear exactly as references cited in the
main body of the document (and be treated as part of the text in terms
of numbering, so be careful when moving tables containing references).

\subsubsubsection{Example}

An instance of a simple table, following the proposed rules follows.
Notice the \Lcs{hline} commands at the beginning and end of the
\texttt{tabular} environment to generate the double lines at the top
and the bottom of the table, as well as the single \Lcs{hline} command
to separate the heading from the data.

\begin{verbatim}
\section{Section title}
Table~\ref{tab:famous} shows three famous mathematical constants.
\begin{table}
\caption{Famous constants}
\label{tab:famous}
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lll}\hline\hline
symbol & description               & approximate value\\\hline
$e$    & base of natural logarithm & $2.7182818285$   \\
$\pi$  & ratio circle circumference to diameter &
                                     $3.1415926536$   \\
$\phi$ & golden ratio              & $1.6180339887$   \\\hline\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Bibliographical references}
\label{sec:biblioref}

References should be cited in the text using numbers within square
brackets: `example~[1], example~[1, 2], example~[1--5]'. This is
achieved with the \Lcs{cite} command. One can also write `see
Ref.~[1]', `Refs.~[1]--[5]', and, at the beginning of a sentence,
`Reference~[2]'. These strings can be produced as follows (see also
\Tref{tab:predef}).
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb!\Bref{bib:mybiba}! or \verb!\Ref~\cite{bib:mybiba}! 
      typeset, \eg `Ref.~[1]'.
\item \verb!\Refs~\cite{bib:mybiba}--\cite{tab:mybibb}!, 
      typesets, \eg `Refs~[1--5].
\item \verb!\Bref[b]~\ref{bib:mybibc}! typesets, \eg `Reference~[3]'.
       The optional argument \texttt{[b]} indicates that the word
       `Reference' should be typeset in full, in particular at the
       beginning of a sentence.
\end{itemize}

Bibliographical references should appear in consecutive numerical
order and should be listed in numerical order at the end of the
text. Punctuation can be used either within or outside the brackets,
but please ensure one method is used consistently throughout the
contribution.

\subsubsection{List of references}

The list of references (the \Lcs{bibitem} entries) must all be grouped
inside a \Lenv{thebibliography} environment, as follows.

\begin{verbatim}
\section{Section title}
Work by Einstein~\cite{bib:einstein} as well as \Bref{bib:gravitation}
explains the theory of relativity.
...
\begin{thebibliography}
\bibitem{bib:einstein}} ...
\bibitem{bib:gravitation} ...
  ...
\end{thebibliography}
\end{verbatim}
As shown, each \Lcs{bibitem} is identified with a reference key
(\texttt{bib:einstein}, \texttt{bib:gravitation}, \etc), which allows
one to refer to the relevant bibliography entry with a
\verb|\cite{bib:einstein}| command in the text. The information about
each entry can be specified in a separate file, \eg
\texttt{mybib.bbl}, which can be read by the \BibTeX{} program for
generating the list of references (see a \LaTeX{} manual or Chapter~12
of Ref.~\cite{bib:mittelbach2004} for details).

Unless you are near the bottom of the last page of text, do \emph{not}
start a new page for the list of references, but continue on the same
page. Note that in the list of references it is unnecessary to state
the title of an article or chapter in proceedings or in a collection
of papers unless a page number cannot be quoted, \eg for forthcoming
publications.

For abbreviations of names of journals quoted in the references, see
the \emph{Journal abbreviations} entry available from the Web page at
the URL \url{http://cern.ch/DTP/dtpgrammar.htm}\footnote{% The Reviews
of Modern Physics site: \url{http://rmp.aps.org/info/manprep.html}
also has a list.}. The entry \emph{Citation of references} on the same
Web page shows more details on how to present references.

If you need to provide a bibliography, this should come after the list
of references.

\subsection{Footnotes}

Footnotes are to be avoided. If absolutely necessary, they should be
brief, and placed at the bottom of the page on which they are referred
to. Take care when citing references in the footnotes to ensure that
these are correctly numbered.

\subsection{Referencing structural elements}
\label{sec:crossref}

In this section we give a general overview of \LaTeX's reference
mechanism which makes it easy to reference structural elements. First
a \Lcs{label} command, with a unique \emph{key} as its argument to
identify the structural element in question, must be placed in the
source, as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item For sectioning commands, such as \Lcs{section},
      \Lcs{subsection}, \Lcs{subsubsection}, the \Lcs{label} command
      must \emph{follow} it.
\item Inside \texttt{figure} and \texttt{table} environments, the 
      \Lcs{label} command must be placed \emph{after} the \Lcs{caption}
      command.
\item Inside an \texttt{equation} environment the \Lcs{label} command
      can be placed anywhere.
\item Inside an \texttt{eqnarray} environment, the \Lcs{label} command
      can be used to identify each line, so that it must be placed
      \emph{before} each end-of-line \Lcs{\bs}. If for a given line no
      line-number has to be produced, a \Lcs{nonumber} command should
      be used.
\item Inside an \texttt{enumerate} environment a \Lcs{label} command
      can be associated with each \Lcs{item} command.
\item Inside a \texttt{footnote} a \Lcs{label} command can be placed
      anywhere.
\end{itemize}
As seen in all the examples in this document, for reasons of clarity
it is best to place the \Lcs{label} command immediately
\emph{following} the element if refers to (rather than inserting it
inside its contents).

From any place in the document one can refer to a structural element
identified with a \Lcs{label} command with the help of a \Lcs{ref}
command. An example follows.

\begin{verbatim}
\section{My first section}\label{sec:first}
Figure~\ref{fig:fdesc} in Section~\ref{sec:second} shows \dots
\begin{table}
\caption{table caption text}\label{tab:tdesc}
...
\end{table}
\begin{equation}
\exp{i\pi}+1=0\label{eq:euler}
\end{equation}
\section{My second section}\label{sec:second}
In Section~\ref{sec:first} contains Table~\ref{tab:tdesc} and
Eq.~\ref{eq:euler}
\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics[...]{...}
caption{Text of figure caption}
\label{fig:fdesc}
\end{figure}
\end{verbatim}
To easily differentiate between references to the various structural
elements it is good practice to start the key with a few characters
identifying it (\eg \texttt{sec:} for a sectioning command, such as
\Lcs{section}, \Lcs{subsection}, \etc, \texttt{fig:} for figures,
\texttt{tab:} for tables, and \texttt{eq:} for equations, including
\texttt{eqnarray} environments (which should have a \Lcs{label}
command placed before the \Lcs{\bs} if you want to identify the line
in question). The second part of the key should identify the
particular element clearly, \eg use of a mnemonic component, such as
\texttt{eq:euler} in the example of the equation reference
above. Avoid using keys with only digits, such as \texttt{f1},
\texttt{f2}, \etc, since, if for any reason structural elements are
eliminated or change position in the source, confusion can result.

\subsection{Appendices}

Each appendix should be laid out as the sections in the text.
Appendices should be labelled alphabetically and be referred to as
Appendix A, Appendices A--C, \etc Equations, figures and tables should
be quoted as Eq. (A.1) and Fig. A.1, \etc

\subsection{Acknowledgements}

If required, acknowledgements should appear as an unnumbered
subsection immediately before the references section.

\section{Spelling and grammar}

For more information on English grammar rules and commonly misused
words and expressions (including a guide to avoiding `franglais'),
please see the files available from the DTP Web pages.

\subsection{Spelling}

CERN uses British English spelling, and `-ize' rather that
`-ise'. Here we provide a few examples for guidance:
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{@{}lX}
-il:     & fulfil (not fulfill) \\
-re:     & centre (not center) \\
-our:    & colour (not color) \\ 
-gue:    & catalogue (not catalog, but analog is used in electronics) \\ 
-mme:    & programme (not program, unless referring to a computer
           program) \\ 
-ell-:   & labelled (not labeled) \\ 
-ce/-se: & licence (noun), license (verb), practice (noun), practise (verb) \\ 
-ize:    & organization, authorize. \\
         & Exceptions to this rule include advise, comprise, compromise, 
           concise, demise, devise, enterprise, exercise, improvise, 
           incise, precise, revise, supervise, surmise, surprise, televise.\\
\end{tabularx}
\end{flushleft}

\subsection{Punctuation}

\subsubsection{Hyphen}

Hyphens are used to avoid ambiguity, \ie in attributive compound
adjectives (compare `a little used car' and `a little-used car'), to
distinguish between words such as `reform' (change for the better) and
`re-form' (form again), and to separate double letters to aid
comprehension and pronunciation (\eg co-operate).

Hyphens are also used if a prefix or suffix is added to a proper noun,
symbol, or numeral, and in fractions: \eg non-Fermi, 12-fold,
three-quarters.

\subsubsection{En dash}

En dashes are used to mean `and' (\eg space--time, Sourian--Lagrange)
or `to' (\eg 2003--2004, input--output ratio).

\subsubsection{Em dash}

An em dash is used as a parenthetical pause. Simply type with no space
on either side (\emph{Word} will automatically insert a thin space),
\eg `the experiment\,---\,due to begin in 2007\,---\,represents a
major advance...'. In \LaTeX{} you can use \texttt{{-}{-}} and
\texttt{{-}{-}{-}} for entering an en dash, and an em dash,
respectively.

\subsubsection{Quotation marks}

Double for true quotations, single for anything else. Single within
double for a quotation within a quotation. Our preferred method of
punctuation around quotation marks is to place punctuation marks
outside the quotation marks, to avoid any ambiguity: Oxford has been
called a `Home of lost causes'.


\subsubsection{Apostrophe}

Do not use in plural acronyms (\eg JFETs), decades (1990s).  Do use
in plural Greek letters and symbols (\eg $\pi$'s).

\subsubsection{Colon, semi-colon, exclamation mark, question mark}

Please note that in English these punctuation marks do not require a
space before them.

\subsection{Lists}

In a series of three or more terms, use a comma (sometimes called the
serial comma) before the final `and' or `or' (\eg gold, silver, or
copper coating). In a run-on list, do not introduce a punctuation mark
between the main verb and the rest of the sentence.  Avoid the use of
bullet points.

For a displayed list there are two options:

\begin{itemize}
\item[i)]  finish the introductory sentence with a colon, start the
           first item of the list with a lower-case letter, finish it
           with a semi-colon, and do the same for all items until the
           last, where a full stop is placed at the end of the text
           (as here);
\item[ii)] finish the introductory sentence with a full stop, start
           the first item with a capital letter and finish it with a
           full stop, and the same for the remaining items.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Capitalization}

Capitalize adjectives and nouns formed from proper names,
\eg Gaussian.  Exceptions to this rule include units of measure
(amperes), particles (fermion), elements (einsteinium), and minerals
(fosterite) derived from names.  Capitalize only the name in
Avogadro's number, Debye temperature, Ohm's law, Bohr radius.

Never capitalize lower-case symbols or abbreviations. When referring
to article, paper, or report, column, sample, counter, curve, or type,
do not capitalize.

Do capitalize Theorem I, Lemma 2, Corollary 3, \etc

\subsubsection{Acronyms}

In the first instance, spell out the acronym using capital letters for
each letter used in the acronym, and provide the acronym in
parentheses, \eg Quark--Gluon Plasma (QGP).

\subsection{Numbers}

Spell out numbers 1 to 9 unless they are followed by a unit or are
part of a series containing the number 10 or higher (as here); numbers
are always in roman type. Numbers should always be written out at the
beginning of a sentence.

\subsection{Symbols}

Names of particles, chemicals, waves or states, covariant couplings
and monopoles, and mathematical abbreviations are written in roman
type.

Symbols of variables (\ie anything that can be replaced by a number)
should be typed in \emph{italics}.

Take care that this is consistent throughout the contribution.

\subsection{Units}

Symbols for units are printed in roman type. Symbols for units derived
from proper names are written with capital letters (\eg coulomb, 6~C).
Write the unit out in full in cases such as `a few centimetres'.  When
using symbols insert a \emph{non-breaking space} between the number
and the unit, unless it is $\%$ or superscript, \eg \verb!10~cm!,
\verb!100~GeV!, \verb!15~nb!, but \verb!20\%!, \verb!27$^\circ$C!. To
help you typeset units correctly, \Tref{tab:predef} shows a set of
predefined commands that are defined in the CERN \LaTeX{} class files.
For instance, the examples above could have been entered
\verb!\Unit{10}{cm}!, \verb!100\UGeV!, \etc, where these commands work
both in text or math mode. These \verb!\U...! commands typeset a
non-breaking space preceding the unit.  Each of these commands have a
partner ending in `\texttt{Z}', which omits this space, \eg
\verb!100~\UGeVZ!. These variants can be useful when combining several
units.

Please see the file on symbols and units, available from the DTP Web
pages, for a list of abbreviations for the most commonly used
units\footnote{NIST also has a useful summary on the subject, see
\url{http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/.}}.

\section{The \texttt{cernrep} class file}

The Web page at the URL \url{http://cern.ch/DTP/dtpcernreport.htm}
contains a class file (\texttt{cernrep.cls}) that authors should
download to prepare their contribution. There is also an example file
(\texttt{cernrepexa.tex}), which can be used as a model. The \LaTeX{}
source of the present document (\texttt{cernrep.tex}), as well as its
typeset result (\texttt{cernrep.pdf}) are available as well.

\subsection{Predefined commands}

The CERN \LaTeX{} class files have predefined commands for
often-occurring abbreviations of markup entities. \Tref{tab:predef}
gives a list. The unit commands provide the non-breaking space between
the value and the unit's name.

\subsection{Obtaining the class file and making your contribution available}

The \texttt{cernrep} class file loads a number of external packages,
as well as some CERN-specific extensions. You need a recent \LaTeX{}
setup (such as \TeX{}live 2004, see the TUG Web site
\url{http://www.tug.org} for details) to fully exploit its
possibilities. 

In the CERN Linux environment these CERN-specific classes become
available if you include the latest \texttt{texlive} in your
\texttt{PATH} (see
\url{http://xml.cern.ch/textproc/texliveunixcern.html}).  For the
convenience of off-site users a {\small ZIP} file \texttt{cernrep.zip}
contains a set of files to supplement their (recent) setup.

Please contact the editors to determine the best way to submit your
contribution.  Please submit the \LaTeX{} file and separate files for
each of the figures and the bibliography if using \verb|bibtex| to
generate the list of references.  Figures or photographs that are not
available in electronic form should be sent to the editors by post.

\section{Things to do and not do when preparing your \LaTeX{}
  contribution}
\label{app:donotdo}

Authors accumulate over time a certain experience and habits for
preparing their scientific documents electronically using their
preferred text editor and document processing system. When submitting
a \LaTeX{} source file to an editor for publication, it is very
important that the source of the contribution be readable and
understandable to the various people who have to intervene in the
production process.

\subsection{Make your source easy to read and maintain}

In order to make life easier for yourself as well as for the
professionals who will have to deal with your source file, we invite
authors to take into account the following general suggestions.
\begin{itemize}
\item Use, as far as possible, only basic \LaTeX{} commands, including
  those of the packages that are loaded by the
  \texttt{cernrep.cls}. In particular, for graphics inclusion, use the
  \Lcs{includegraphics} command rather than its deprecated precursors
  (\Lcs{epsffile}, \Lcs{epsfig}, \etc). For math expressions, see
  \Sref{app:amsmath}.

\item Do not use \TeX{} commands, but their \LaTeX{} equivalents. In
  particular, \Lcs{def} should never be used to (re)define commands,
  since there exists \Lcs{newcommand}, or \Lcs{providecommand}, which
  will issue an error message if the command name is already in use.
  Basic \LaTeX{} commands or environment should \textbf{never} be
  redefined. 

\item Do not use \texttt{\$\$} for delimiting a display math formula,
  but use the \LaTeX{} construct \Lcs{[} \dots \Lcs{]}, instead. More
  generally, numbered equations can be produced with the
  \texttt{equation} environment, with \texttt{equation*} its
  unnumbered variant.

\item Do not use one-letter (or even two-letter) lower-case commands as
  command definitions, since \TeX{}, \LaTeX{}, or some extension
  packages define these already. Indeed, many hours have been lost, to
  understand that the redefinition of, for instance, \Lcs{r} on one of
  the several thousands of lines of a \LaTeX{} source of an author
  upset the typesetting several pages downstream. In general, it is
  good practice to define new commands starting with an upper-case
  letter and giving it a name with a mnemonic meaning, \ie one which
  is three or more characters long.

\item Do not replace \LaTeX{} environments by commands, \eg \Lcs{be},
  \Lcs{ee}, and \Lcs{bee} and \Lcs{eee} for delimiting the
  \Lenv{equation} and \Lenv{eqnarray} environments, \Lcs{bi},
  \Lcs{ei}, to delimit the \Lenv{itemize} environment, \etc Saving a
  few keystrokes can be no excuse for obfuscating the source
  unnecessarily, thus making it more difficult to understand and
  maintain.  Authors spend, in general, many weeks, preparing an
  article or a report. Hence it is certainly worth while to use, as far
  as possible, standard \LaTeX{} commands, and to define new ones only
  to make the source \emph{easier} to read and re-use.

\item Do not use \TeX's state changing font commands \verb!{\rm ...}!,
  \verb!{\it ...}!, \verb!{\bf ...}!, \etc, but use the \LaTeX{}
  equivalents: in text mode \verb!\textrm{...}!, \verb!\emph{...}!,
  \verb!\textbf{...}!, and inside math mode, \verb!\mathrm{...}!,
  \verb!\mathit{...}!, \verb!\mathbf{...}!, \etc

\item Do not reference equations, sectioning commands, figures, or
  tables by explicit, hard-coded numbers in your source, but use
  \LaTeX's cross-reference mechanism, using a mnemonic key to identify
  each structural element clearly (see \Sref{sec:crossref}).

\item Do not redefine \LaTeX's basic counters, such as
  \texttt{equation}, \texttt{section}, \etc Numbering of such
  elements is defined by the \texttt{cernrep} class file and should 
  not be modified by the authors, who should use only \LaTeX{}'s
  cross-reference mechanism to refer to equations, figures, tables,
  \etc (see \Sref{sec:crossref}).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{The \texttt{amsmath} extensions}
\label{app:amsmath}

Recent developments around \LaTeX{}, often sponsored and driven by
scientific publishers, have ensured that structural elements and math
constructs in particular are easily delimited and their sense made
clear. The American Mathematical Society have done a great job with
their \texttt{amsmath} extension, which is loaded by default in the
\texttt{cernrep.cls} class. Therefore, we would like our authors to
use the conventions and \LaTeX{} constructs of that package, rather
than the pure \TeX{} primitives. This is all the more important as we
want to take full advantage of the possibilities of hypertext and the
Web, where \TeX{} primitives, because they are not clearly delimited,
are much more difficult to handle (see previous paragraph).

Below we give a few often-occurring mathematics constructs, first in
their \TeX{} form (to be avoided), their \LaTeX{} equivalent (to be
preferred), and the typeset result.

\begin{itemize}
\item \Lcs{over} to be replaced by \Lcs{frac}.
\begin{description}
\item[\TeX{}] \verb!${Z^\nu_{i}\over 2 \Lambda_{\rm ext}}$!
\item[\LaTeX] \verb!$\frac{Z^\nu_{i}}{2 \Lambda_{\text{ext}}}$!
\item[Result] $\displaystyle\frac{Z^\nu_{i}}{2 \Lambda_{\text{ext}}}$
\end{description}
\item \Lcs{choose} to be replaced by \Lcs{binom}.
\begin{description}
\item[\TeX{}] \verb!${m + k \ choose k}$!
\item[\LaTeX] \verb!$\binom{m + k}{k}$!
\item[Result] $\binom{m + k}{k}$
\end{description}
\item \Lcs{matrix} family to be replaced by corresponding environments.
\begin{description}
\item[\TeX{}] \verb!$\matrix{a & b \cr c & d\cr}$!
\item[\LaTeX] \verb!$\begin{matrix}a & b\\c & d\end{matrix}$!
\item[Result] $\begin{matrix}a & b\\c & d\end{matrix}$
\item[\TeX{}] \verb!$\pmatrix{a & b \cr c & d\cr}$!
\item[\LaTeX] \verb!$\begin{pmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{pmatrix}$!
\item[Result] $\begin{pmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{pmatrix}$
\item[\TeX{}] \verb!$\bmatrix{a & b \cr c & d\cr}$!
\item[\LaTeX] \verb!$\begin{bmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{bmatrix}$!
\item[Result] $\begin{bmatrix}a & b\\c & d\end{bmatrix}$
\end{description}
\item Cases construct: use the \texttt{cases} environment.
\begin{description}
\item[\LaTeX{} without \texttt{amsmath}] 
\begin{minipage}[t]{.7\linewidth}
\begin{verbatim}
$$
{\rm curvature~} R = {6K\over a^2(t)} \quad
\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
K=-1\quad&{\rm open}\\
K=0      &{\rm flat}\\
K=+1     &{\rm closed}
\end{array}\right.
$$
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\item[\LaTeX{} with \texttt{amsmath}]
\begin{minipage}[t]{.7\linewidth}
\begin{verbatim}
\[
\text{curvature } R = \frac{6K}{a^2(t)} \quad
\begin{cases}
K=-1\quad&\text{open}\\
K=0      &\text{flat}\\
K=+1     &\text{closed}
\end{cases}
\]
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\item[Result] 
\begin{minipage}[t]{.7\linewidth}
\[
\text{curvature } R = \frac{6K}{a^2(t)} \quad
\begin{cases}
K=-1\quad&\text{open}\\
K=0      &\text{flat}\\
K=+1     &\text{closed}
\end{cases}
\]
\end{minipage}
\end{description}
\item \texttt{amsmath} offers symbols for multiple integrals.
\begin{description}
\item[\TeX{}] \verb/$\int\!\!\int\!\!\int {\rm div}~\vec{\rm E}\,{\rm d}V/\\
              \verb/ = \int\!\!\int\vec{\rm E}\,{\rm d}\vec{\rm S}$/
\item[\LaTeX{}] \verb/$\iiint \text{div}~\vec{\mathrm{E}}\,\mathrm{d}V/\\
              \verb/ = \iint\vec{\mathrm{E}}\,\mathrm{d}\vec{\mathrm{S}}$/
\item[Result] $\iiint \text{div}~\vec{\mathrm{E}}\,\mathrm{d}V
               = \iint\vec{\mathrm{E}}\,\mathrm{d}\vec{\mathrm{S}}$
\end{description}
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{cernrep} class loads, amongst others, the \texttt{amsmath}
and the \texttt{amssymb} packages. The latter package defines many
supplementary commands and symbols that with \TeX{} would have to be
constructed from more basic components. See \Refs~\cite{bib:voss2005}
and \cite{bib:pakin2003}, or Chapter~8 of~\Bref{bib:mittelbach2004}
for more details.
